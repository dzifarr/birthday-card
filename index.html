          Happy Birthday Palmer! 🎉I'm proud of the woman you have grown to
          become. I see your hustle and dedication to get a degree and I'm so
          proud of that!

          I pray for every good thing in this world to happen to you so that
          everyone will see the hand of God in your life.
